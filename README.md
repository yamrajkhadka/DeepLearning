## Day 1: Perceptron - A Simple Neural Network Model
On Day 1 of my Deep Learning journey, I explored the **Perceptron**, a foundational algorithm for binary classification. In this session, I learned how to:

- Build a Perceptron model from scratch.
- Visualize decision boundaries.
- Train a Perceptron on a dataset.
- Evaluate model accuracy.
- Understand the Perceptron loss function.
- Identify the limitations of the Perceptron.

### Key Learnings

#### 1. What is a Perceptron?
- A **Perceptron** is a single-layer neural network that performs binary classification.
- Unlike Perceptrons, **Neurons** in multi-layer networks are part of more complex models with non-linear activation functions.

#### Key Difference:
A Perceptron is a simplified mathematical model of a neuron used in machine learning, while a Human Neuron is a complex biological cell involved in brain functions.

### 2. Building and Visualizing a Perceptron
I implemented a **Perceptron** in Python and visualized its decision boundary between two classes.

#### Code Implementation:
