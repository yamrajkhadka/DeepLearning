# Day 1: Perceptron - A Deep Dive

## Summary:
On Day 1 Deep Learning, I explored the Perceptron, a basic machine learning model used for binary classification. I implemented it from scratch, visualized its decision boundary, trained it, and learned about its loss function and limitations.

## Key Learnings:

### 1. **Introduction to the Perceptron:**
The perceptron is a simple linear classifier used for binary classification. It takes in multiple inputs, performs a weighted sum, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function (sign function). The model predicts one of two possible outputs.
