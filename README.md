# Day 1: Perceptron - A Deep Dive
On Day 1 Deep Learning, I explored the Perceptron, a basic machine learning model used for binary classification. I implemented it from scratch, visualized its decision boundary, trained it, and learned about its loss function and limitations.
## Key Learnings:
### 1. **Introduction to the Perceptron:**
The perceptron is a simple linear classifier used for binary classification. It takes in multiple inputs, performs a weighted sum, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function (sign function). The model predicts one of two possible outputs.

# Day 1: Perceptron - Building and Training a Simple Model

## Overview:
On Day 1 of my 100 Days of Deep Learning challenge, I learned about **Perceptrons**, the fundamental building block of neural networks. I implemented a perceptron from scratch, visualized its decision boundary, calculated its accuracy, and understood its limitations.

## Key Learnings:

### 1. **What is a Perceptron?**
   A **Perceptron** is a simple linear classifier that makes decisions based on a weighted sum of the input features. It's a crucial part of machine learning, especially in understanding the foundation of neural networks.

#### Perceptron vs Neuron:
- **Perceptron**: A single-layer neural network that makes decisions based on a linear function.
- **Neuron**: A more complex unit found in multi-layer networks with nonlinear activation functions, capable of solving more complex problems.
